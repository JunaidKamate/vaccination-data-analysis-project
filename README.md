# 💉 Vaccination Data Analysis Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global vaccination data to extract meaningful insights related to vaccine coverage, incidence rates, and disease cases across different countries. The main goal is to visualize vaccination trends, identify gaps, and help in data-driven decision-making for improving immunization programs.

## 📊 Data Sources
- **Cleaned Data**: Contains preprocessed datasets for analysis.
- **Raw Data**: Original data files before cleaning.
- **Databases**:
    - `Vaccination_Project.db`: SQLite database used for analysis.
    - `Vaccination_Project_unlocked.db`: Safe version used in Power BI.

## 📈 Visualizations
Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to answer key questions:
1. **Easy Questions**:  
    - Average coverage by vaccine.  
    - Top 10 countries with highest coverage.  
    - Lowest coverage countries for DTP vaccine.

2. **Medium Questions**:  
    - Trend of disease cases over time.  
    - Year-wise comparison of coverage, incidence, and cases.

3. **Hard Questions**:  
    - Average coverage across regions.  
    - Correlation analysis between coverage and incidence rate.

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing → Python (Pandas, SQLite)  
- Database Management → SQLite  
- Visualization → Power BI  
- Version Control → Git & GitHub

## ✅ How to Use
1. Open the `.pbix` Power BI file to explore the dashboards.  
2. Access cleaned data in the `Cleaned_Data` folder.  
3. Explore raw data in the `Raw_Data` folder.  
4. Use the SQLite databases for custom queries.
